/**
 * @module events/ordering
 * @description Per-contract ordering gate for contract event ingestion.
 *
 * Events from the same contract carry a per-contract `sequence` (ledger
 * order). When RPC pages are fetched in parallel or queue workers complete
 * out of order, the ingestion funnel can observe an event before its
 * predecessors. Applying out of order corrupts projections that assume a
 * strict event history (e.g. milestone releases must follow funding).
 *
 * This gate partitions processing by contract:
 *  - events that arrive in order are applied immediately;
 *  - events that arrive ahead of a gap are **held** in a bounded buffer
 *    until the missing predecessor arrives (or a bounded timeout expires);
 *  - events behind the applied high-water mark are duplicates;
 *  - impossible jumps (a gap larger than the bounded buffer could ever
 *    fill) and buffer overflow are rejected with a structured code instead
 *    of being silently buffered or dropped.
 *
 * Boundedness:
 *  - `maxPendingPerContract` caps how far ahead of the high-water mark one
 *    contract may run (a larger gap is rejected as impossible).
 *  - `maxTotalPending` caps the aggregate buffer across all contracts so a
 *    pathological backlog of many gapped streams cannot exhaust memory.
 *  - `holdTimeoutMs` bounds how long a held event waits for its
 *    predecessor; expired events are surfaced via {@link expireHeld} so the
 *    caller can record/quarantine them (they are never silently dropped).
 *
 * The gate is intentionally in-memory and single-process: it orders work
 * *within* one ingestion instance. Cross-instance ordering is the queue's
 * job (each instance applies the same per-contract rules). `getSnapshot()`
 * exposes the high-water marks, pending counts, and recent rejections for
 * observability.
