/**
 * @module context
 * @description Request-scoped context propagation via AsyncLocalStorage.
 *
 * Provides a module-level `requestContextStorage` that middleware and services
 * can run work inside, and a `getContext()` accessor to read the current
 * request-scoped values from anywhere in that call chain (including async
 * functions that no longer have the Express `req`/`res` available, such as
 * background job processors and event-ingestion workers).
 *
 * This intentionally mirrors `src/middleware/requestContext.ts`, which already
 * tracks `requestId`/`correlationId` for HTTP middleware. This module is a
 * wider, open-shaped store so services can enrich it with additional fields
 * (e.g. `actorId`) without coupling to Express.
 *
 * @security
 *  - Values live only for the duration of the `run()` callback; nothing is
 *    persisted globally, so context cannot leak across unrelated requests.
